README

Please exactly follow, because i dont yet know any other method -_-
The steps should probably work ;)

1) make a new folder and cd into it.
2) clone the  folders in your local folder 'Gdesign' you created now.
   --install django if not done here inside Gdesign or if showing error--
3) virtualenv django
4) source django/bin/activate
5) cd src
6) python manage.py runserver
